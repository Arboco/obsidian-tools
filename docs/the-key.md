Description 


# Explanation 
## Option 
- keyring: Corresponds to -k flag, bundles the key in a group with other keys 
- agenda: Corresponds to -a flag, sorts keys after priority and date similiar to the agenda in  emacs. The agenda key consists of priority and date (optional). Date format is `yyyy-mm-dd`
- cards_cleared: How many cards you have cleared of this key. Can be sorted with with -c flag.
- key_favorite: Give the key a personal rating. Can be sorted by the value with the -f flag. 
- skip: Put in either Question, Inspiration, Task, Wiki or Combined to skip directly to the pool you know you want instead of going trough the select menu 
- timer: set the seconds for inspiration so you are not prompted any longer 
## Card Pool increasers 
- links: use obsidian link to include those notes in the pool 
- tags: use tags to include those notes in the pool 
- string: includes all notes that have that particular string in a line. The most powerful application of this is being able to use pretty much any yaml property now to add files. Add each string in a separate line with the property name incrementing like seen in the example
- regex: like string but uses ripgrep -P sensitive regex
- cardstring: adds cards based on string contained within cards 
- family: the-pool related option, include the parent, children or siblings of the note where the key resides in
- c-tags: files must contain each of those tags, requires 2 tags a minimum and works with up to 3
- subtags: include only the cards given that subtag

## Filters 
- a-subtags: filter the entire card pool to only include cards with that subtag
- contains: filter based on a line inside the card 
- f-tags: removes notes with that tag
- f-links: removes the linked notes
- f-string: removes notes with that string
- f-subtags: removes all cards with that subtag
- remove: remove based on a line inside the card 

Keys work the same as any other card type and can be given a description and images to display as long there are no empty lines. 

## On Combinability 
All properties should work with multiple arguments and being combined with as many properties as one lines. If this is not the case this is a bug.
